        <p>Hii My Squishie,
I'm writing this to let you know how much you mean to me, and it can feel a little repetitive cz I tell you all the time already, but I want you to know it one more time on your birthday! Yeah yeah I know I'm a little late but I just had to get my baby a greeting card. Thank you for coming into my life when you did, it's difficult for me to accept it but I truly was lost without you. You came in and showed me that distance means nothing and if a person truly cares for you, you will feel it every day. And I did, I still do, it's the most amazing feeling ever. To wake up and go to sleep everyday knowing I'm loved by this cute ass human bean. Also, HOW ARE YOU SO PRETTY like w h a a a a!! I'm so in love with you, I hope you know. Thank you for making me want to live. I'm glad I was able to remind you just how much you deserve to be happy. I love your smile, it's my favourite in the whole world, and the way your eyes become tinyy when you smile, oh my lord IT'S SO C U T E. 
You are my everything baby. You make my heart so happy I get happy tears sometimes!
I absolutely adore every single moment we spend together, watching things with you, taking silly quizzes together or just ranting on call, it feels like a blessing really, being able to share my life with you. Thank you for everything, my love. I love you so so so much. Happy Birthday, Shnookums ðŸ¤­
PS: You're really hot.
Yours,
Baby Bunny</p>
